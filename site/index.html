        <p style="font-size: 20px; word-spacing: 1px;letter-spacing: 0.5px;">I'm a Person who always wants to be positive in live no matter what what happens in life. Because there may be ups and downs in anyone's life
            that doesn't mean our life is a rollercoster. We need to be positive about ourselves and about future because in life sorrow is more common
             than happiness. One can only understand the value of happiness when sorrow exists in life. It is same like we only understand the value of light
             when we live in darkness.

            I believe than amazing things will happen when we get honest to ourself and start doing what we love, what , makes us happy. Our lives literally slows down. We stop wishing for the weekend. We stop merely looking forward to special events. We begin to live in each an every moment and We start feeling like a human being. We just ride the wave that is life, with this feeling of contentment and joy. We move fluidly, steadily, calm and grateful. A veil is lifted, and a whole new perspective is born.
